Here is **Xin Wu (Tina, 吴欣)**.

📖 I am currently a graduate student 🔭. My main research interests are image processing, artificial intelligence 💻 + medical 🏥, with a focus on imaging medicine, and intelligent Chinese medicine diagnosis. My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Multimodal learning.

🤔 Only two things make me move.

i. ⌨️ 🧱 Working with Attention. It's all I need.

ii. Life was like a box of chocolates 🍫. You never know what you're going to get.

iii. ❤️ I like running 🏃‍♀️, eating 🐮, traveling 🏝, and bicycling 🚴.
