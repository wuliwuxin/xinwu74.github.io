**Abstract:** <p align="center"> Multilabel image classification aims to assign images to multiple possible labels. In this task, each image may be associated with multiple labels, making it more challenging than the single-label classification problems. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have not met the performance requirement in utilizing statistical dependencies between labels in this study. Additionally, data imbalance is a common problem in machine learning that needs to be considered for multilabel medical image classification. Furthermore, the concatenation of a CNN and a transformer suffers from the disadvantage of lacking direct interaction and information exchange between the two models. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model called CTransCNN...</p>
